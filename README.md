### Todo

The `Todo` component is the main container of the application. It manages the state of the todo list and handles the addition of new tasks.

- **State:**
  - `todos`: Array of tasks.
  - `inputRef`: Reference to the input field.
- **Methods:**
  - `add`: Adds a new task to the list.
  - `useEffect`: Handles the initial load of tasks from `localStorage` and saves tasks to `localStorage` whenever the `todos` array changes.

### TodoItems

The `TodoItems` component represents an individual task in the list.

- **Props:**
  - `no`: Unique identifier for the task.
  - `display`: Style property (e.g., line-through for completed tasks).
  - `text`: The task description.
  - `setTodos`: Function to update the list of tasks.
- **Methods:**
  - `toggle`: Toggles the completed state of a task.
  - `deleteTodo`: Deletes a task from the list.

## Styles

The applicationâ€™s styles are located in the `css/todo.css` and `css/todoitems.css` files. These styles define the appearance of the application, including the layout, fonts, colors, and other UI elements.

## Future Improvements
